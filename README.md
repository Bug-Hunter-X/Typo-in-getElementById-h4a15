# Uncommon HTML Bug: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can easily be overlooked in HTML and JavaScript code.

The bug involves a simple typo in the `getElementById` method, causing the script to fail silently, instead of throwing an error. This could lead to unexpected behavior, as the element won't be hidden as intended. 

The solution provides the correct method and highlights the importance of careful coding.
